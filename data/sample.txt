# Diffusion Models (Quick Notes)

Diffusion models are generative models that learn to reverse a gradual noising process.

- Forward process: add Gaussian noise step-by-step until data becomes nearly pure noise.
- Reverse process: learn denoising steps to reconstruct data from noise.
- Trained via variational bounds or simplified losses predicting noise.
- Popular variants: DDPM, DDIM, latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion).
- Strengths: high-quality samples, stable training; trade-offs: sampling steps can be slow.

Key idea: parameterize the noise (or velocity) at each timestep and iteratively denoise.
